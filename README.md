# freeCodeCamp Projects

A collection of React projects developed during self-teaching efforts on freeCodeCamp in April-June 2023. These projects represent initial steps in my journey into web development.

## Projects Overview

- **Random Quote Generator**: A simple app that displays random inspirational quotes.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: A productivity timer following the Pomodoro Technique for work/break intervals.
- **Markdown Previewer**: A live markdown editor that renders text in real-time as styled HTML.
- **JavaScript Calculator**: A basic calculator built to perform simple arithmetic operations.
- **Drum Machine**: An interactive drum pad that plays drum sounds when buttons are clicked.

Post these projects, I have expanded my skills into full stack development ([See here](https://github.com/loc-codes/fullstackopen)), 
with more advanced projects and a deeper understanding of React alongside backend development.
